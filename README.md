Privacy policy for Google Play.

This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, 
use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use my Apps.
I Ben Mohammad do not collect or use your data in any way outside of anonymous analytics
provided to me by default from Google (e.g. crash reports, number of users who have downloaded
the app). I currently use AdMob ads by google, and they will collect data about your advertisement
viewing habits such as what you clicked on. However, I do not have any use for your data and 
have no plans to collect any ourselves, and certainly would never sell it to an outside party.
For a better experience, while using our Service, I may require you to provide us with certain 
personally identifiable information. The information that I request will be retained on your device 
and is not collected by me in any way.
