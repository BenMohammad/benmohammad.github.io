                              use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use my Apps. 
                              I Ben Mohammad do not collect or use your data in any way outside of anonymous 
                              analytics provided to me by default from Google (e.g. crash reports, number 
                              of users who have downloaded the app). I currently use AdMob ads by google, 
                              and they will collect data about your advertisement viewing habits such as 
                              what you clicked on. However, I do not have any use for your data and have no 
                              plans to collect any ourselves, and certainly would never sell it to an outside 
                              party. For a better experience, while using our Service, I may require you to
                              provide us with certain personally identifiable information. The information 
                              that I request will be retained on your device and is not collected by me in any way.
